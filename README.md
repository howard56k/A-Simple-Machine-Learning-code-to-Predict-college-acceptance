# This is my First ML project That i made several months ago
Dont judge this was my first so-called project even though its super simple
This is coded in python and uses scikit
This code is from a while ago but I never uploaded or not and Im pretty sure I was watching Siraj Raval tutorial while making it.
The data is from niche Carnegie Mellon Comp Sci Acceptance and it uses a simple Tree Classifier which kinda like a yes or no and with this together it isnt
accurate but it can give you a general idea if you can get accepted but in no means does it equal your actual chances since it doesnt involve outsde data.
